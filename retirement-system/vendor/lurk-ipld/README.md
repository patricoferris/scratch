# Lurk IPLD

This is an experimental and at-least transiently incompatible fork of [libipld](https://github.com/ipld/libipld). It exists to serve the needs of [Lurk](https://github.com/lurk-lang/lurk-rs) until stable solutions can be upstreamed.

# Rust IPLD library

> Basic rust ipld library supporting `dag-cbor`, `dag-json` and `dag-pb` formats.
